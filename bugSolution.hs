The solution replaces the use of `undefined` with a more appropriate default value or error handling.

```haskell
undefinedFunction :: Int -> Int
undefinedFunction x = x + 1

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = undefinedFunction 0 -- Using 0 as default value
  print result

--Alternative solution with Maybe type:
undefinedFunctionMaybe :: Maybe Int -> Maybe Int
undefinedFunctionMaybe (Just x) = Just (x + 1)
undefinedFunctionMaybe Nothing = Nothing

mainMaybe :: IO ()
mainMaybe = do
  let result = undefinedFunctionMaybe Nothing --Handles missing value
  print result
```
